# GitProfiler 🚀

GitProfiler is a proof-of-concept (POC) project built with Django. It matches GitHub profiles with job postings, providing a unique way to find potential candidates or job opportunities.

## Functionality 🛠️

GitProfiler allows users to input a GitHub username and a job posting URL. It then generates a report comparing the GitHub user's profile with the requirements in the job posting. This report can be downloaded for further analysis.

## Technology Stack 💻

GitProfiler is built using the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
- **YAML**: Used for configuration files.

## Deployment 🚀

The project is currently in the POC phase and deployed with Docker.

## Future Plans 📈

This is just the beginning! We plan to add more features such as:

- Advanced matching algorithms for more accurate results.
- Integration with other job posting sites.
- User accounts for saving and managing reports.
